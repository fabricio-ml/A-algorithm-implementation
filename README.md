# A* Algorithm

This Python script implements the A* pathfinding algorithm for 2D grids. It includes a Node class, Manhattan distance heuristic, and the core A* function. The algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path around obstacles, demonstrated on a sample grid. It balances explored distance with estimated remaining distance to optimize pathfinding.

## Prerequisites
